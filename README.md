# IQ-calibration

This project is meant to implement amplitude calibration for BBNAPS1.

Specification of the instrument can be found [here](https://libaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

## Major steps
- [x] Experiment data I/O
- [x] Qubit state discrimination
- [] 'amplitude-frequency analysis'
- [] AWG programming
- [] Linearity verification
